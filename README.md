# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

on-the-job ticket: A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

##Lessons Learnt

I was motived by the fact that I will be making a diference to others by modifying this code so its accessible.
I built the project because I am a developer who loves challenges, most especially when it has to do with a project that will make a difference.
the project solves accessibility issues.
I learnt that It's not every developer that follows coding conventions, and it is important to always review other peoples code and making sure it meeets your organisations standards before using it.
